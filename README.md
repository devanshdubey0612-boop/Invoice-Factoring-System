# Invoice Factoring System

## Project Title
**Invoice Factoring System**

## Project Description
The Invoice Factoring System is a blockchain-based platform built on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts. This decentralized application enables businesses to tokenize and sell their unpaid invoices to investors or factoring companies at a discounted rate, providing immediate liquidity without waiting for payment terms to complete.

Businesses can list their unpaid invoices on the platform by specifying the invoice amount and discount rate they're willing to accept. Investors can then browse available invoices and purchase them as tokens, providing immediate cash flow to the business while earning a profit when the original invoice is paid.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to democratize access to working capital for businesses of all sizes by creating a transparent, efficient, and decentralized invoice factoring marketplace. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:

- **Eliminate intermediaries**: Remove traditional factoring companies' high fees and lengthy approval processes
- **Provide instant liquidity**: Enable businesses to convert unpaid invoices into immediate cash flow
- **Create investment opportunities**: Allow investors of all sizes to participate in invoice factoring with minimal capital requirements
- **Ensure transparency**: All transactions are recorded on-chain, providing complete visibility and trust
- **Enable global access**: Break down geographical barriers, allowing businesses and investors worldwide to participate

## Key Features

### 1. **Invoice Tokenization**
- Businesses can list unpaid invoices as tradeable tokens on the blockchain
- Each invoice is assigned a unique ID for tracking and verification
- Invoice details include amount, discount rate, and seller information

### 2. **Flexible Discount Rates**
- Sellers can set their own discount rates based on urgency and market conditions
- Automatic calculation of selling price based on the discount percentage
- Transparent pricing visible to all potential buyers

### 3. **Instant Settlement**
- Smart contract-based transactions ensure immediate transfer of ownership
- No delays or paperwork required for invoice purchases
- Automated buyer authentication and verification

### 4. **Platform Analytics**
- Real-time statistics tracking total invoices, active listings, and sales
- Volume tracking for market insights
- Historical data for trend analysis

### 5. **Decentralized and Trustless**
- No central authority required for transactions
- Smart contracts enforce all rules automatically
- Immutable record of all transactions on the Stellar blockchain

## Future Scope

### Short-term Enhancements (3-6 months)
